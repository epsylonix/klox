# KLox

This is a reimplementation (WIP) of the Robert Nystrom's [Lox programming language](http://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) interpreter.


To build the project and run the interpreter you would need to install JDK and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

## Running the interpreter

To start the interpreter run:
```
    gradle uberjar
    java -jar .\build\libs\klox-1.0-SNAPSHOT-uber.jar
```
